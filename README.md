## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS FlexBox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to handle a multi-step form in React, focusing on managing multiple states and ensuring proper validation at each stage. By working through this process, I understood how to efficiently track and update the state for different form fields across various steps, ensuring that user inputs are preserved as they navigate through the form. Additionally, I learned how to implement validation to prevent users from progressing to the next step without providing the required information or correcting any errors. This experience taught me the importance of both state management and validation in creating a smooth and reliable user experience in multi-step forms. 

### Continued development

I am planing to use this form in my other projects.
